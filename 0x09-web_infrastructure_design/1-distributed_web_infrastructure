1. Distributed web infrastructure

Additions:
---------

+ Another server for redundancy/failover, in case the primary goes down. Both servers running Linux OS
+ A HAproxy load balancer to distribute traffic load using round robin algorithm. This algorithm builds
  a queue and walks through it, sending one request to each server.
+ The load balancer is supporting an Active-Active deployment. Both servers are active and handle requests
  concurrently for improved scalability and high availability. On the contrary, Active-passive deployments
  one server active and the other(s) on standby so that if the active instance fails, an agent shuts down
  the active instance completely and brings up the standby instance.
* Database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster enables database administrators to replicate data stored
  in more than one server simultaneously.
* With reference to application servers, "primary" and "replica" nodes refer to different types of server
  instances in clustered application environments. The primary node is the main server instance with the
  authoritative data and application logic, where client requests are executed. The replica node is a secondary
  instance in the cluster that replicates the data and app logic from the primary node for high availability
  and fault tolerance.

Infrastructure issues
---------------------
- No firewall implementation. The network is insecure and susceptible to rogue attacks.
- There is no monitoring mechanism between the two servers, thus no failover strategy in case of outage
