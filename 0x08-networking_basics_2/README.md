## Objectives
* What is localhost/127.0.0.1?
> **localhost** is the name of the host on the current computer used to access it. In the IPv4 address scheme, *localhost* resolves to the IP address *127.0.0.1*
* What is 0.0.0.0?
> **0.0.0.0** may be used by a host as its own source address in IP when it has not yet been assigned an IP address.
* What is /etc/hosts?
> The hosts file (/etc/hosts) is a plain text that operating systems use to translate hostnames into IP addresses.
* How to display your machineâ€™s active network interfaces?
> Running `ifconfig` on the terminal will display the status of currently active interfaces.

## man or help:
* `ifconfig`
