General
-------
+ A server is a hardware device or software virtual environment running a server application that receives,
  porcesses and serves static content.
+ The application server computes dynamic web content as per user request.
+ A domain name is a user friendly address for identifying and accessing online website resources.
+ The type of DNS record used for www.foobar.com is an A record. This serves to translate the domain name
  into an IP address.
+ A web server receives web requests and serves web pages with the requested information.
+ A database serves as a store for data relevant to the organization. The database has the additional
  responsibility of organizing and fetching the data requested by user.
+ The server is using TCP/IP to serve requsted pages back to the user over the network.

Design Flaws
------------
- The web server is the only server handling web requests. In case of failure, there is no fail over server
  to mitigate againt downtime. This is a single point of failure (SPOF)
- FOOBAR.COM will, from time to time, need to deploy new code or post updates to existing code. The downtime
  required for this will mean that users will not be served in that maintenance window.
- As it is, there is only one web server, application server and database server, which can only handle up
  to a certain limit of requaets at a time. If user traffic increases beyond this critical limit, the servers
  will be overwhelmed.
